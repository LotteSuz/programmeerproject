# Project Proposal

## Problem
YourGym is a cool new gym which offers free weights training and group lessons. They need a web application to recruit members, keep track of the group lessons schedule and sell branding.

## Solution
A django written web application will enable people to subcsribe to YourGym, browse the timetable, enroll for classes and shop products. The gym personnel can monitor members, class subscriptions and webshop orders.
