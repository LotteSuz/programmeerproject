# Process

## Day 1
Today I wrote the project proposal. I decided customers who aren't a member of the gym can use the webshop, and personnel can overview not only orders and the schedule but also the type of subscription members have. Furthermore, I chose not to develop a chat for members and their coach at the gym, because this would be too extensive for the time available for this project.

## Day 2
Today I worked on the design of my webapp, sketched the association between different parts of the application and set up the models' structure. For the prototype I decided to focus on the django eventtools framework and on the difference in user types (personnel, guests, members without group lessons, members with group lessons) and the consequences this type has on the functionality and interface of the webapp.

## Day 3
Today I set up the project, created all necessary html pages and linked them to eachother. I asked feedback about the feature where non-members can order from the shop as well, and both Lars and Nils adviced me to register guests with name and emailadress only, instead of a regular member account. I then worked on the index page and scss.

## Day 4
During the standup we discussed possible problems/bottlenecks for the coming weeks of development. Nils and Lars agreed that the calendar function could be difficult to implement, which I why I will begin working on this today. Furthemore, the option to shop as a guest could be timecostly as well, therefore this is the first thing on my to do list for next week.
