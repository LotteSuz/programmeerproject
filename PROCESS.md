# Process

## Day 1
Today I wrote the project proposal. I decided customers who aren't a member of the gym can use the webshop, and personnel can overview not only orders and the schedule but also the type of subscription members have. Furthermore, I chose not to develop a chat for members and their coach at the gym, because this would be too extensive for the time available for this project.

## Day 2
Today I worked on the design of my webapp, sketched the association between different parts of the application and set up the models' structure. For the prototype I decided to focus on the django eventtools framework and on the difference in user types (personnel, guests, members without group lessons, members with group lessons) and the consequences this type has on the functionality and interface of the webapp.
