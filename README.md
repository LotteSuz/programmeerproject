# Programmeerproject

## Overview
For this project I will build a web application for a gym. Future members can subscribe to a program, after which they can browse the timetable, subscribe for classes and shop products. The gym personnel can monitor members, class subscriptions and webshop orders.

## Requirements
__• Subscriptions__ The index page contains the 2 different kinds of subscriptions available, members can choose to join the gym and are redirected to registration.

__• Register__ Users are able to register for 2 different kinds of subscriptions.

__• Members__ Personnel can browse the memberbase, and for each member see their subscription.

__• Login/Logout__ Members can login to get access to the timetable, and logout.

__• Webshop__ The webshop is available to members and visitors who can order with a guest account.

__• Timetable__ Personnel can add classes to the schedule, which can be viewed by all members.

__• (Un)Subscribe for classes__ Members with a subscription for group lessons can enroll for classes, and unsubscribe if needed. Members with a non-group subscription can view the timetable, but not enroll for classes.
